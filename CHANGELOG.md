## v2.2

**Major-ish Changes**

* Python 3 is now supported (TODO).
* A VP model can now be spanned across multiple machines in a network.
* FTRL modeling is now supported. Use `ftrl` for the interface.
* `run` now supports predicting without training and training without predicting.
* Models now have `get_beta_weights` function that tells you the weights of the model. Use `model.get_beta_weights(read=False)` to write out the `.weights` file for inspection or `model.get_beta_weights()` (`read=True` by default) to return a list of weight data in memory.
* `data_file=True` parameter will keep a VW-format data file of all input.
* `ngram` and `skipgram` can now be set.
* `autolink` is now supported.
* `affix` is now supported.
* A `daemon` can be started from referencing a model file explicitly.
* `split_object` can split a list or a dictionary into multiple parts for spreading across cores.
* `cost_rate` is now a validation metric that creates a weighted rate of false negative and false positive cost.
* `auc` now takes a threshold by default. `threshold=None` will not use it.
* Error handling introduced in v2.1.1 is expanded to all functions (TODO). Fully resolves issues #1 and #6.
* Shuffle files are automatically cleaned after if `clean` is not `False` (TODO).
* If shuffle files are found, they won't be remade unless `force` is `True` (TODO).

**Minor/Technical Changes**

* Adds a test suite (TODO).
* Extends error handling to `run` function (TODO).
* VW models have a nice printed name.
* All VW processes are spun down on run completion (TODO for non run_parallel).
* Daemons no longer use the node to calculate the port if port is passed in as an argument.
* Clear error messages now exist for VP input.
* Adds Travis.

**Bugfixes**

* Correctly predicts with a daemon on a single dictionary.
* Errors clearly if the model name has a string. Resolves issue #12.
* The daemon can now render predictions outside of the range [-1, 1].
* `:` and `|` are explicitly disallowed as inputs (TODO).

#### v2.1.5

* Fix a bug in how MCC and Average Accuracy are calculated. >.<
* Added a function `confusion_matrix` to return a dictionary with the confusion matrix data.
* Added `beta` parameter to `f_score`.

#### v2.1.4

* Data from a Cassandra query can be loaded using `load_cassandra_query`.

#### v2.1.3

* Only creates one thread per VP daemon.

#### v2.1.2

* Handle UTF encoding issues in VP input.

#### v2.1.1

* Allow custom port to be specified for a daemon.
* Switch to using Pathos library for multiprocessing.
* Fixed bugs in creating and using daemons for predictions.
* When using `run_parallel` error that occurs on a particular core is now captured and printed clearly to the user.
* The spanning tree now spins down when an error occurs, preventing further errors occuring from trying to reconnect to a spanning tree. Resolves #1 and #6 for `run_parallel`.

## v2.1

**Major-ish Changes**

* Evaluation functions added to VW: Log loss, RMSE, percent correct, TPR, TNR, FPR, FNR, precision, recall, F-score, MCC, average accuracy, and AUC.
* Models now import from `vowpal_platypus.models`
* Logistic regression now works from 0 to 1 instead of -1 to 1.
* Utility functions now import from `vowpal_platypus.utils`
* Daemon functions now import from `vowpal_platypus.daemon`
* `run_parallel` supports the pre v2 `run` function for running a manual function for each model on each core.

**Minor/Technical Changes**

* Announcement of shuffling no longer erroneously occurs on single core operations.

## v2.0.0

**Major-ish Changes**

* Changed the `run` function to dramatically reduce the amount that needs to be hardcoded.
* Added grid searching.
* Added `termination` parameter for BFGS.
* Change `safe_remove` to take wildcard arguments.
* `split_file` takes an argument to remove headers and now returns a list of the resulting filenames.
* Added error messages to parameter checking.
* Announce multicore shuffling.
* Added quieting to `daemon_predict`.
* `passes` defaults to 1.

**Minor/Technical Changes**

* Ports now spin down silently on process close rather than at the end. Only ports that exist are spun down.
* The VW class now operates on a parameter hash rather than passed in values.
* Spanning ports are no longer defined.
* Only spin down ports that exist.
* Removed a unneeded debugging statement.
* For `load_file`, error if the file is empty.
* Fixed a bug in `load_file` for length-1 keys.
* Fixed a bug in hash parsing for non-string input.

-

#### v1.0.1

* Fix conflict between spanning port and daemon port.
* Allow VP to work on one core.
* Fix bug where `quiet` would not actually quiet model output.

## v1.0.0

* Initial pre-release.
